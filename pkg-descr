Webistrano is a Web UI for managing Capistrano deployments. It lets you manage
projects and their stages like test, production, and staging with different
settings. Those stages can then be deployed with Capistrano through Webistrano.

Webistrano's purpose is to make the deployment of multi-stage and
multi-environment scenarios easy. Further it allows you to track who deployed
what, when to which servers and be alerted by email on each deployment.
